## Can we predict Heart Disease?
=========================

### Project Overview

Can we predict whether patients suffered from heart disease using other variables?


Patients of all ages and sex can suffer from heart disease. With this project, I want to see if there are underlying conditions that can increase a patient's chance of suffering from heart disease.

We can use machine learning to see underlying causes of Heart disease, whether some patients are more likely and why. If we can see links between certain attributes, lifestyle choices and heart disease, we can inform the general population on how to lessen their heart disease chances.

I will treat the 'HadAngina' column as my target variable for my classification problem. I will try different models to see what features are useful to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.
